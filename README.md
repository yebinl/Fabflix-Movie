  Movies search and purchase website
  
  In the WebContent folder, there are all the html and jsp files which are used to display content.
 
  In the controller and models folders, there are all the backend logical code which are used to provide the services.
  
  With this website, user can login (with google recaptcha auth), can browse all the movies sorted by genres or alphabet, can choose the movies they like and add to the shopping cart. And I also developed a manage page for administrator. An administrator can add movies, delete movies, update moves and manage user informations.
